## How It Works
- Products are stored in a **JavaScript array** inside `script.js`.
- When a user clicks "Add to Cart", the item is saved in **localStorage** so it persists across pages.
- The **Cart Page** dynamically loads cart items, allowing updates and deletions.
- The **Search bar** filters products in real time.
- The **Checkout form** validates input fields before confirming an order.

##  Challenges Faced
- Implementing **cart persistence** across multiple pages without a backend â†’ solved using `localStorage`.
- Designing a **responsive grid layout** for products â†’ solved using CSS Grid and media queries.
- Ensuring smooth **form validation** on the checkout page â†’ solved with JavaScript event listeners.
- Simulating a payment process without a backend â†’ limited to form validation and confirmation message.
